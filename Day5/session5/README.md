# Session 5 - CSS Polish: Transitions, Transforms, Responsive Images

## Overview
This session focuses on enhancing UI interactivity and responsiveness using modern CSS techniques. Key objectives include smooth transitions, transform-based micro-interactions, and adaptive images.

## Tasks
- Implement **hover** and **focus** effects with CSS `transition` for smooth animations.  
- Apply **transform** properties (`scale`, `rotate`, `translate`) for interactive micro-effects.  
- Set up **responsive images** using `<picture>` and `<img>` with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.  

## Deliverables
- `components.css`  
  - Contains examples of transitions and transforms applied to cards, buttons, and images.  
- Responsive images configured for multiple screen sizes to optimize loading and display.  

## Notes
- CSS variables are used for consistent colors, transitions, and spacing.  
- The project emphasizes **pure HTML and CSS**, without JavaScript.  
- All cards scale on hover and rotate on click for interactive feedback.  
- Images adjust dynamically to viewport width using `srcset` and `<picture>` sources.
